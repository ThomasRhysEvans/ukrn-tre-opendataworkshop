# Benefits and Concerns with Open Data 


Data should always be open.

Data sharing is not suitable for qualitative research.

You should share everything, it's not good enough to share partial data.

Sharing data leads to critical evaluation and judgements made about you as an individual

Sharing a data file is enough and all that's needed to be open.


*NO!*

Open as is possible, as closed as is necessary. 
It's different for all projects, and it should very much be considered on a project-by-project basis.
Some progress is better than none.
Examples of individuals being 'caught out', judged or otherwise discriminated upon for data sharing are few and far between.
