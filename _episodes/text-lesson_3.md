#Preparing your Project for Data Sharing

In this session we're going to look through the research process, and how to make data sharing easier by making very small changes throughout the research process. It all starts when designing your study by making a clear data management plan. To get us started, it might help to think about the following:

- What type of data will I collect and how?
- Do I want the data to be publicly available, available through gatekeeper, or simply catalogued?
- What of the data I plan to collect would be most valuable to share publicly?
- What of the data I could share might be problematic for identifying individuals?
- Where do I want the data to be stored, and for how long?
- What else would I have to do/share to make the data shared make sense to anyone who might access the data?

## Activity

We're now going to spend a few minutes editing your participant information sheet and consent form templates to facilitate open data sharing. Here we want to focus on being as transparent and clear to participants about what exactly will be shared, how (public or private) and in what ways you are protecting them (e.g. how you will de-ensure datasets do not clearly identify any given individual).
