This is a time for you to get some refreshment and clear your mind a little in preparation for the next part of the workshop. Give your eyes and body a brief break by avoiding screens and being active for a few moments. You don't have much time, but you could: make a cup of tea (or other beverage), reach out to a friend you haven't spoken to in a while, wake your body up with a quick boogie, or indeed something else. Enjoy, and see you in the next section soon.
