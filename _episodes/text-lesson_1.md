# Welcome & Aims of the Session

Hello everyone! Welcome to the start of this workshop on Data Sharing/Open Data!

My name is Tom (He/Him/His) and I am an Associate Professor in Occupational Psychology at the University of Greenwich. I have developed this whole workshop in conjunction with the UK Reproducibility Network to support individuals within Psychology, and possibly beyond!, with practical guidance and support for implementing open data practices into their research. My personal goal is to provide you the support, advice and guidance to help you make small changes to your work to improve transparency and reproducibility.

The ethos of the training as a whole is that we're trying to help you make small changes to refine your workflow (actual, practical changes), that better is good (we're not looking to totally transform your workflow to an unrecognisable state!) and that there should be no homework (you're busy so everything is built-in). 

Finally, I really want this to be a safe and inclusive training space and community so I ask that everyone remember that we're all on different learning journeys and we be as respectful to others as possible. 



## Activity

Take just a few minutes to know those who you don't already know on the course. Say hello, tell us your prefered names/pronouns if you like, and then share your understanding/experience of open data/data sharing. It's always nice to get to know each-other a little more so feel free to also tell us something about you as a person (favourite food and pets are always a good option!).



## Aims

In this training session, we're going to focus on designing open data into a project from the very start. The training will walk you through the research cycle from the very beginning. You can of course implement these changes at different parts of the research cycle, but we're going to focus on new/upcoming projects to show you how many of the issues that mgiht be encountered at the later stages can be easily negotiated from the start. You can then work through previous projects to consider what might be sharable, whilst also having a clear understanding of how to implement it for any future works.



## Outcomes

By the end of the session you will have:
- A balanced understanding of the role of Open Data 
- An understanding of the role of Data Management Plans
- An understanding of FAIR data principles and the role of codebooks/data libraries
- An understanding of the various licenses that can be applied to data files
- Experience of using the OSF (osf.io) to share
- Confidence with sharing data in future projects and resources to help guide you through it

Whilst we are all missing face-to-face conferences and the novelty notebooks, pens and other bits and bobs that come with them, I unfortunately don't have any goodybags for you. However, below is a list of the useful things you'll walk away with from this workshop:
- A range of statements suitable for placing within ethics applications
- A data management framework to apply for all future projects
- An updated participant information sheet template with data sharing built-in
- An updated consent form template with data sharing built-in
- A data sharing protocol to support ethical data sharing
- A guide for how to share data (and other such materials) using the OSF
