# Negotiating Ethics for Data Sharing

In this section, we're going to have a discussion as to how we can prepare ethics submissions ready for institutional approval (IRBs). Data sharing norms are changing, but ethics systems and indeed gatekeepers are sometimes not always fully prepared for supporting data sharing. 


## Activity 
Review your local ethical approval processes and identify where you can make comments about data sharing. Design some boilerplate statements which can be input into these sections to reassure reviewers and institutions that data sharing can be ethical and advantageous. Some examples are below:

- When will the data be deleted? Participants explicitly consent to having their data shared publicly following project completion. A copy of the final dataset (de-identified by removing demographic details) will be made publicly accessible on the project's OSF page. Any raw data files will be permanently deleted from XX/XX/XXXX.
- Where will data be stored? De-identified data from this project will be publicly accessible from the project OSF page (osf.io/XXXX). Upon completion of data collection, the data will be saved upon my university Microsoft OneDrive and then deleted from Qualtrics. Any raw data will only be shared amongst the research team through Microsoft OneDrive where it will be password protected.
