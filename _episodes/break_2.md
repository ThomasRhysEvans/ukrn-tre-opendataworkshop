This is a time for you to reflect upon the workshop and to ask any remaining questions you have about data sharing. 

We'd love for you to complete the post-workshop survey to let us know whether we delivered as promised. We hoped to help you make small changes to refine your actual workflow to make modest improvements to facilitate data sharing, leaving you with no homework. Do let us know how we/you did!

Otherwise, please use these few moments to clear your mind a little in preparation for the remainder of your day. 

Thanks for joining us!
