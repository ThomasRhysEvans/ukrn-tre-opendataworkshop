## Data Sharing Considerations During Data Collection

In this section, we're going to explore what we should be doing when collecting data with participants to ensure their consent.

### Quantitative

Making quantitative data open is often relatively simple by declaring what parts of their data will shared, when, and how, on the ethical documentation as we prepared earlier. However, we also know is that participants typically don't really read the informed consent forms particularly thoroughly (Perrault & Nazione, 2016). What could we do to improve this?

- Verbally brief/debrief participants in addition to the forms
- Make explicit statements about what or will not be shared
- Refine consent forms to encourage explicit agreement to data sharing
- Share with participants an example of what/how data will be shared
- Share details of the eventual home of the dataset (e.g. OSF page)

### Qualitative

Making qualitative data open can often be more problematic when considering the amount of detail and identifying information participants may offer. It's good to ensure you are being transparent about the use of their data before and after the data collection. What could you do?

- Ask questions to ensure the participant understood the open data comments of the ethics forms
- Remind participants that their data will be made openly accessible after data collection
- Run through the protocols you will implement to support de-identifying data
- Decide upon a pseudynm and other such details to replace sensitive information
- Negotiate what can be shared about demographic details explicitly (e.g. their specific age or age category)
- Remind participants at the end of the data collection how, why and/or when their data will be shared
- Provide participants with documents that are intended to be shared to ensure they are happy to have all details made openly available
- Returning to participants with questions about what they feel comfortable sharing




#### Activity

Take 5 minutes to plan an effective consent protocol for your project, considering the ethical materials we developed earlier.
